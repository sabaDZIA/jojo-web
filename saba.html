      <p class="citata">	~ Jolyne Cujoh's catchphrase, inherited from her father. <br>
        <br>
        “	Two men look out through the same bars, one sees the wall and the other, <br> stars... Which one I am? [...] Of course I'll see the stars... <br> until I see my father, I want to keep <br> on looking at the stars.</p>


      <p class="joli">Jolyne Cujoh is the main protagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure:<br> Stone Ocean and the deuteragonist of the JoJo's <br> Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven videogame.

        The daughter of Jotaro Kujo, Jolyne is the only female JoJo to date. <br> At the conclusion of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean, <br> a character named Irene appears, heavily implied to be an alternate universe counterpart of Jolyne. <br>
        
        She was voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle, <br> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven, and various commercials, <br> and is voiced by Ai Fairouz in the anime adaptation, who is the fan of the JoJo series in Japanese and Kira Buckland in English.</p>

      <P class="ambavi">
        Jolyne's childhood was often spent without her father, as Jotaro was<br> mostly at work even when she was in need of attention. When she was <br> fourteen, her life as a teen began to spiral downward upon being <br> mistaken for a suspect in a robbery she didn't commit and then fleeing  <br> from an officer by stealing a motorcycle. Upon being arrested and detained <br> in a holding cell, falsely charged with the crime, she and her mother pleaded her innocence <br> and even begged Jotaro to bail her out. However, as he did not believe her, <br> she ended up being sent to juvenile detention. <br>

When her mother divorced Jotaro, Jolyne became even more frustrated when he left <br> the family. Soon, she joined the Hell Riders gang and spent more time <br> getting into trouble. At 19, having cleaned up her act and left <br> the gang, she went on a date with a preppy rich boy named Romeo. Upon <br> driving home, Romeo and Jolyne were in a car accident, Romeo having fatally <br> hit a pedestrian. Worried that he would be charged with reckless driving and dropped from <br> a university's waiting list, Romeo decided to take the corpse and dump it <br> somewhere, persuading Jolyne to help him and forget <br> about the entire incident. A few days later, however, <br> Jolyne was found at home and arrested.

      <P class="info">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure : Stone Ocean
        During her first transfer, Jolyne befriended a fellow inmate named Ermes Costello who explains the basics of surviving prison. The former soon leaves to receive a gift from her mother, a pendant which she pricked her finger on some time later. She then woke up finding herself suddenly able to unravel herself into strings. However due to a lack of friends and resources, Jolyne decided to stay around. She was later placed in a cell with a fellow inmate named Gwess who owned a stand capable of shrinking people. Gwess herself had a habit of forcing her victims to wear dead animal skins in their shrunken forms. Jolyne however was able to fight back and defeat her, resulting in Gwess being the one who's scared of her cellmate.
        
        Some time later, she was visited by Jotaro Kujo and despite Emporio's warning she went to the visitor room. She left her father in response despite his warnings that she had been framed and an enemy stand user was hunting her down. The two were soon attacked by a pair of stand users, one of which is Enrico Pucci who was able to steal Jotaro's stand disc and memory disc. Jotaro's last words, confessing that he cherished his daughter, shook Jolyne to the point that she decided to stay behind in order to find the discs. After Ermes succesfully defeats an opponent, she and Jolyne discover where a stash of stand discs are located.
        
        Unfortunately, said stash was guarded by a humanoid colony of plankton named Foo Fighters. After a lengthy and difficult fight, the two were able to defeat the colony. Despite Ermes’ protests, Jolyne still decides to spare F.F. who in return gives them the stand disc they were looking for. The colony later uses a dead body as a disguise in order to be in the prison and assist Jolyne. During free time in the courtyard, Jolyne decided to teach F.F. how to play catch with friends. They were soon challenged by another prisoner to perform one thousand throws and catches for two hundred dollars. After succeeding, that same prisoner gave the same challenge for one thousand dollars, intriguing Ermes who took the challenge with F.F. Due to interference from a guard, Ermes loses the challenge and the prisoner who gave the challenge reveals that she is a stand user. Ermes ends up losing money, a gold tooth, and her liver, forcing Jolyne and F.F. to take another challenge while chasing the enemy stand user until she was defeated and had returned what was taken.
        
        Some time later, the Speedwagon Foundation agrees to take the stand disc with Jolyne ending up having to travel through the male ward of the prison.
        
        During her time there, she was assisted by Weather Report, a friend of Emporio. The three were quickly attacked by Lang Wrangler, forcing them to hide for a while. Unfortunately, the enemy stand's ability was to remove gravity and this resulted in the stand disc floating away. Weather however was able to take on the enemy stand user himself, forcing his opponent to bring back gravity. Jolyne and Weather proceeded to chase down Lang who had used his stand to cause air to float up. Once again, the amnesiac proved to be useful as he was able to use his own stand to conjure up oxygen suits for himself and his companion. The fight continued until Jolyne was able to yank the enemy stand user into the airless place the she was in. Lang finally deactivates his stand, pulling Jolyne towards him who proceeds to beat him up. She was later able to give the disc to the Speedwagon Foundation.
        
        While Jolyne was looking for Ermes, F.F decides to share the latter’s backstory through information she received. After Ermes’ fight against Sports Maxx, F. F heals her and Jolyne due to the injuries the two suffered. Some time later, a large fight broke out in the male ward which F. F and Jolyne was visiting while looking for DIO's bone. Jolyne in particular was attacked by a guard which turned out to be a stand user. The guard's stand was able to bring meteors down to the prison which Jolyne was able to dodge repeatedly until she was able to headbutt her opponent. While looking for DIO's bone, Jolyne met Anasui for the first time and the two along with F. F arrive at the swamp where the group encountered The Green Baby. Said baby was protected by a stand capable of slowly shrinking anyone who approaches. However due to the stand user's interest with Jolyne's birthmark, the fight was averted. Unfortunately, said baby was swallowed by an indestructible stand, forcing F. F to go hunt down its user. Meanwhile, Jolyne and Anasui were forced to stay with the enemy stand which turned out to be hostile and melted their tongues. The male prisoner was able to defeat said stand by implanting a frog brain in it which stopped its attack. Unfortunately, F. F accidentally led the group to an ambush. Jolyne arrived just in time for F. F to speak to her before dying.
        
        Some time later, Jolyne was placed in a maximum security ward along with Emporio by a warden. The warden's stand was capable of limiting the amount of information the two can remember. Jolyne was able to outsmart her opponent by writing things she needed to remember on her arm before finally being able hunt down her opponent and defeat her. Jolyne's group soon escaped the prison and was offered a helicopter. On the helipad however, they were attacked by an enemy stand capable of utilizing unseen creatures known as rods. Jolyne was able to distract her opponent by lighting herself on fire which had the additional effect of convincing the enemy stand user to light himself on fire. After interrogating her opponent, Jolyne and her team continued on their journey. Upon arriving in their destination, they were attacked by another enemy stand, this one capable of digging up past events and trapping targets in them. Jolyne and Ermes were soon trapped in a crashing plane before finding an oddity and escaping, allowing them to defeat the enemy stand user. The two were soon affected by Weather's powered stand, Heavy Weather which was turning creatures into snails. Despite almost losing, Pucci was able to defeat Weather thanks to a distraction and Heavy Weather's effect on the group ceased. They soon arrive at Cape Canaveral where Pucci had already evolved his stand which gained the ability to redirect gravity. This ability allowed him to turn people inside out, something Jolyne avoided by knotting her body into a mobius strip.
        
        As the group grew closer to defeating Pucci, his stand gains its final evolution. The priest quickly regains the upper hand, going everywhere at high speeds as the group watches in dismay. At some point, Pucci drops a large number of knives on Jolyne just as Jotaro was stopping time. He wound up sacrificing himself to save her. Ermes and Anasui died shortly after and Jolyne decided to tie Emporio onto a dolphin before sending him away. She engaged in one final battle against Pucci, dying in the process off-screen.</P>
